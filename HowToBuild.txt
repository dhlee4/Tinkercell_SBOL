==================================================================================================
REQUIRED LIBRARIES & PACKAGES
==================================================================================================

C and C++ Compiler (see below for recommended compilers)
CMake (www.cmake.org)
Qt 4.5 or higher (qt.nokia.com/products/)


OPTIONAL (recommended):
Python -- installers are located in win32 folder
GNU Octave (optional) -- download the installer from www.octave.org


WINDOWS ONLY:
IF you want to automatically create the Windows installer and/or upload the installer to Sourceforce (developers),
then you will also need to install Inno Setup and WinSCP. You will also need to specify the location of
these executables in the CMake GUI (details given in step 12 below)


UBUNTU 11.+ ISSUES:
Several libraries have been moved from /urs/lib to  /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu or /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu (for 32-bit and 64-bit, respectively). If you get link errors, try copying them into /usr/lib. Some of these libraries include libSM, libz, libICE, libX11. However, the latest CMake should include these directories in the list of link directories.




RECOMMENDED C/C++ COMPILERS:
XCode on Mac
MinGW in Windows
GCC in Linux



==================================================================================================
BUILDING TINKERCELL
==================================================================================================

1. Install the following libraries or packages: python, subversion, octave (optional)
In Linux, just use apt-get install libx11-dev python-dev subversion octave octave-headers
In Linux, you might also need to install libssl-dev because some versions do not have it by default


2. Install cmake, available from www.cmake.org
In Linux, use apt-get install cmake cmake-qt-gui




3. Install Qt (4.5 or above)
In Linux, use apt-get install libqt4-core libqt4-gui libqt4-xml libqt4-opengl qt4-dev-tools


In Windows and Mac, download the QtSDK installer and just follow the normal installation process


On all other platforms, do the following:
3a. download and install Qt 4.5.0 (or later) from http://qt.nokia.com/products
3b. extract the Qt compressed file and inside the folder, run the following command:
3c. ./configure -debug-and-release -no-accessibility -no-sql-db2 -no-sql-ibase -no-sql-mysql -no-sql-oci -no-sql-odbc -no-sql-psql -no-sql-sqlite -no-sql-sqlite2 -no-sql-tds -no-mmx -no-3dnow -no-sse -no-sse2 -qt-zlib -qt-gif -qt-libtiff -qt-libpng -qt-libmng -qt-libjpeg -no-openssl -no-qdbus -opengl -no-sm -no-xshape -no-xinerama -no-xcursor -no-xfixes -no-xrandr -no-xrender -no-fontconfig -no-xkb
3d. make (this will take time)
3e. make install (this will also take time)


4. Run cmake-gui (in Windows, double click on the CMake icon on the desktop)


5. In the CMake window,
set tinkercell/trunk folder for the source folder
set tinkercell/trunk/BUILD as the binary folder
change the "Simple View" to "Grouped View" (located next to the search box)




6. Inside the cmake-gui, click the "Configure" button.
When you run this for the first time, you will be asked to select a compiler of your choice.
Suggested compilers: GCC for Linux and Mac (aka. Unix default), MinGW for Windows




7. (optional) This step only applies if you want enable Octave, Python, or Ruby.
This will help you identify whether or not all the directories or libraries that are needed were found.
If you want embedded Python and Octave, enable them under the EMBED group.
In the PYTHON group, check that the libraries and include directories are found.
If they are not found, you will have to set them. Do that same for the OCTAVE group.
Octave headers are problematic in Windows; see the "win32 problems" section near the end of this document




8. (optional) Select one of the TinkerCell lite versions from the TINKERCELL group if you are interested in a different variant of Tinkercell 




9. If the "Generate" button is disabled, click the "Configure" button again




10. After Configure is done, click the "Generate" button.
This will create the makefile or the project file, depending on the compiler you selected in step 7.
Pay attention to the messages in red in the CMake window (not all of them are errors)


THE REST OF THE STEPS DEPEND ON YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM. Follow steps in one of the sections below


--------------------- Linux ------------------------------------
12. Be sure that CPACK_TGZ is selected in the CMake gui
13. Go to BUILD/
14. Run "make package"
15. Run BUILD/_CPack_Packages/Linux/TGZ/run_tinkercell.sh


--------------------- Max ------------------------------------
12. Run BUILD/bin/create_bundled_app.sh
The program will be visible on the desktop


--------------------- Windows ------------------------------------
If you want to create an installer, then pick option 12(a). If you just want to run TinkerCell, select option 12(b)


12(a). If you want to create the TinkerCell installation file using Inno setup, be sure that the check the TINKERCELL_INSTALLER checkbox in the TINKERCELL group located in the CMake GUI window
In the CMake window, under CPack, check CPACK_BINARY_ZIP and uncheck all the other options (unless you are planning to build TinkerCell a different way).
If you want to upload the installer to Sourceforge automatically, check the TINKERCELL_INSTALLER_UPLOAD
You must also have Python installed, because a Python script is used to generate the Inno setup file.
Run BUILD/win32/CreateInstaller.bat


12(b). Go to the BUILD folder are run "mingw32-make package"
Run TinkerCell executable located inside /BUILD/_CPack_Packages/.../TinkerCell




--------------------- Other operating systems ------------------------------------
12. Go to BUILD/
13. Run "make package"
14. Go to _CPack_Packages folder and find the TinkerCell subfolder.
Create the following script and save it as "run_tinkercell"
#!/bin/bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<tinkercell folder>:<tinkercell folder>/plugins:<octave libraries folder>:<python libraries folder>
<tinkercell folder>/TinkerCell
15. Run run_tinkercell

WIN32 PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS
==================================================================================================

Problem: CMake is not able to find MinGW.
Solution: Look for a field in the CMake GUI called CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER.
Set the compiler manually by locating the mingw32-make.exe.
Click "configure" again.




Problem: CMake is not able to find qmake.
Solution: Look for a field in the CMake GUI called QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE.
Set the compiler manually by locating the qmake.exe.
Click "configure" again.


Problem: compile issues due to octave header files
Solution: open the config.h find in the Octave include folder and comment 
the #define HAVE_HDF5 and HAVE_REGEX lines (unless you have these packages 
installed, which is not included with MinGW).




Problem: Visual Studio is giving link errors
Solution: TinkerCellCore should build find with VisualStudio, but the TinkerCell app itself will cause trouble. I don’t why - let me know if you find a solution!
